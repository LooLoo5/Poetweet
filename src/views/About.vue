      A <b>haiku</b> is an unrhymed Japanese poetic form that consists of 17 syllables
      arranged in three lines containing five, seven, and five syllables, respectively.
      A haiku expresses much and suggests more in the fewest possible words.<br>
      The form gained distinction in the 17th century, when Basho, a Japanese poet considered the
      greatest practitioner of the form, elevated it to a highly refined art.
      It remains Japan’s most popular poetic form. The Imagist poets (1912–30) and others
      have imitated the form in English and other languages.

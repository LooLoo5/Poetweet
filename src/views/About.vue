   <h3>Turning tweets into poems since 2018!</h3>
  <p>
      Poetweet takes in two different inputs, which ever you choose,
      and creates a Haiku for a fun and
      innovative way to learn about poetry forms.<br>
      The first form is a public tweet post that is taken and
      then rendered into a Haiku format.<br>
      The second form the app takes in is your personal writing and renders
      the body of text into a Haiku as well.<br>
  </p>
   <!-- <h3>But.. What is a Haiku?</h3> -->
   <br>

    <h3>
           <b>Haiku</b> noun
      </h3>
      <p>hai • ku | \ˈhī-(ˌ)kü
        <br>plural haiku
        <br>
      </p>

      A <b>haiku</b> is an unrhymed Japanese poetic form that consists of 17 syllables
      arranged in three lines containing five, seven, and five syllables, respectively.
      A haiku expresses much and suggests more in the fewest possible words.
      <!-- <br> -->
      <br>The form gained distinction in the 17th century, when Basho, a Japanese poet
      considered the greatest practitioner of the form, elevated it to a highly refined art.
      It remains Japan’s most popular poetic form. The Imagist poets (1912–30) and others
      have imitated the form in English and other languages.

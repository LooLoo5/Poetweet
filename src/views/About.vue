    <p>A haiku is an unrhymed Japanese poetic form that consists of 17 syllables 
      arranged in three lines containing five, seven, and five syllables, respectively. 
      A haiku expresses much and suggests more in the fewest possible words.<br>
      The form gained distinction in the 17th century, when Basho, a Japanese poet considered the 
      greatest practitioner of the form, elevated it to a highly refined art. 
      It remains Japan’s most popular poetic form. The Imagist poets (1912–30) and others 
      have imitated the form in English and other languages.</p>

 # Project Proposal

 **Poetweet**
 *Turning your tweets into poems since 2018*
 We are building an app that will help people learn about and conquer poetry. Using a user's existing Tweets or someone else's (only if public),
 the app will reformat the tweet into a haiku, sonnnet, or even mad lib. The newly created poem will then be fed to a feed
 where others will be able to read and interact with the poems. 

 The challenge will be detecting syllables in words and then producing sensical (though non-sensical will be fun) statements and phrases. We will target high school and college students.

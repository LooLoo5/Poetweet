v1.0 \
Orig. Deployment - December 12, 2018

# Idea
We wanted to encourage people to write, but more importantly, to create and explore poetic forms. As an educational and fun tool, Poetweet turns tweets from Twitter, or your own 140 characters, into Haikus. We hope to bring you more poetic forms in V2, as well as the ability to turn your own tweets from your Twitter account into poems.

# User Guide

Here's how it works:

- On the landing page, either click on 'Create haiku from a tweet' or 'Create a haiku from scratch.'
- Follow the form instructions, then enjoy your newly created haiku.
- Have fun!
